TLC has no trouble with this initial predicate for the same reason
it has no trouble with the initial predicate.
   \[ (b=0)\, \/ \,((b=1) /\ (1=b))\]
Since $(b=1) /\ (2=b)$ is equivalent to $\FALSE$, the initial
predicate in the question is equivalent to $b=0$.  Hence, TLC finds
only a single possible behavior.
